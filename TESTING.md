# Testing the Wallet Headless
The tests on this application use the [`jest`](https://jestjs.io/) framework and are divided in two contexts:
- One with a mocked connection to the infrastructure **(unit tests)**
- One with a live private network environment **(integration tests)**

To run the mocked tests, use the command:
```sh
npm run test
```

To run the integration tests:
```sh
npm run test_integration
```

The data that is used on static code/coverage analysis on GitHub come from the mocked context. So, when adding new code it's important to add tests on the _mocked context_ to cover it.

# Mocked Context
These tests tend to be faster and are focused on the input/output data treatment. Since there is no connection to a live network, there is no state change: all communications are static and hardcoded. 

The configuration for the unit tests are on the [`./jest.config.js` file](https://github.com/HathorNetwork/hathor-wallet-headless/blob/master/jest.config.js). The resulting test coverage is stored on the `./coverage/` folder.

Its mocked connections with the infrastructure are initialized on the [`./setupTests.js` file](https://github.com/HathorNetwork/hathor-wallet-headless/blob/master/setupTests.js). The application config file, the HTTP responses from the mocked network are stored on the [`./__tests__/__fixtures__/`](https://github.com/HathorNetwork/hathor-wallet-headless/tree/master/__tests__/__fixtures__) folder.

### Static state
The responses from the blockchain infrastructure are static and do not change with any manipulations made via HTTP requests. So, all of the blockchain's current state has to be hardcoded on the `http-fixtures.js` and `ws-fixtures.js` files.

# Integrated Context
These tests interact with a _dockerized_ live network build specifically for these tests. This means every transaction have to be mined and processed by the application after its data is received from the fullnode.

So, these tests tend to be slower than the mocked ones, and are more focused on validating the change of state between interactions rather than just input/output validation.

The configuration for the integration tests are on the [`./jest-integration.config.js` file](https://github.com/HathorNetwork/hathor-wallet-headless/blob/master/jest.config.js). The resulting test coverage is stored on the `./coverage-integration/` folder. The private network is fully instantiated following the integration test's [`./__tests__/integration/docker-compose.yml` file](https://github.com/HathorNetwork/hathor-wallet-headless/blob/master/__tests__/integration/docker-compose.yml).

On the [`./setupTests-integration.js` file](https://github.com/HathorNetwork/hathor-wallet-headless/blob/master/setupTests.js):
- The application `config.js` file is retrieved from a fixtures folder
- All benchmarks files are handled to measure test times
- The precalculated wallets persistent file is handled between test suites

### Sequential running
Currently the integration tests must be executed in sequence using the `--runInBand` jest feature. This means many of the tests expects the previous ones to have been run sucessfully and put the network state in a specific condition.

It would be desirable to make every test independent from each other, which would require a different approach to the tests implementation.

## Persistent data
Unlike the mocked tests, these integration tests have two places where state is stored between and after tests and suites. This demands an extra caution when developing the tests to avoid some pitfalls described below.

These data storages are:
- The blockchain
- The pre-calculated wallets file

### The Blockchain
<img src="assets/privatenet diagram.svg"/>

On its default configuration, the test privatenet's fullnode stores blockchain information only on memory. This means that state is kept between each call of `test_network_up` and `test_network_down`.

When calling `npm run test_integration`, in case the test is fully successful, the private network containers will be taken down and the blockchain state is destroyed. In case the test has any failures, the `test_network_down` script will not be executed and will keep the `fullnode`, the `tx-mining-service` and the `cpuminer` running on background for further investigation from the developer.

> ##### ℹ️️ _A note on services' versions:_
> _When new images for the infrastructure services become available and are needed for testing new features, it is important to check if Docker is updating the local images to instantiate them._
> 
> _This can be done using:_
> ```sh
> # List all docker images currently available on the developer environment
> docker image ls
> 
> # If a version is obsolete, update it with
> docker image pull hathornetwork/service-name:latest
> ```

### The pre-calculated wallets file
<img src="assets/precalculated wallets diagram.svg" />

On `test_network_up` the `precalculated-wallets.json` file is copied to the `./tmp/wallets.json` file to be used by the tests, saving time on the calculation of wallet addresses.

Before each test suite, the contents of this JSON are copied to memory using the [WalletPrecalculationHelper](https://github.com/HathorNetwork/hathor-wallet-headless/blob/master/setupTests-integration.js#L70-L71) class. As each test starts a pristine precalculated wallet, the used instances are flagged in memory to avoid reusing dirty data.

After each test suite, this updated data is serialized back into the filesystem on `tmp/wallets.json`, effectively flagging every wallet that was used during the tests.

On `test_network_down` this file is destroyed. But, just like the private network described above, in case the test run fails this step will not be executed and the `tmp/wallets.json` file will be available for debugging.

### Re-using existing state for new test runs
The `test_network_up` and `test_network_down` scripts, when run in isolated, build and destroy the test environment. The `test_network_integration` script is the one actually responsible for executing the tests.

So, if a developer wants to reuse existing blockchain / wallets file, this is possible by running
```sh
npm run test_network_integration
```
